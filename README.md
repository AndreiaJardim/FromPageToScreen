## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the differences between movies based on books and movies with original screenplays. <br>

As we all know, the movie industry is a multi-million dollar industry and a key form of entertainment. For movie directors, the decision of whether to adapt a book or create an original screenplay is crucial and can greatly impact a movie's success.
The main goal of the project is to understand the differences between book adaptations and original screenplay to help directors to make informed choices that maximize the chances of creating successful movies.<br>

By conducting hypothesis testing and data analysis, we sought to uncover insights that can assist movie directors in making informed decisions during the book adaptation process. The project explores factors such as average gross revenue, ratings, and number of votes (Popularity) to provide valuable guidance to directors.

## Description
The project involves gathering movie-related data from various sources, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and conducting hypothesis tests to analyze the differences between movies based on books and movies with original screenplays. The data includes variables such as rank, year, title, gross revenue, ratings, and votes.<br>
As a final product, it was developed a Power BI report, to assist movie directors in analysisng and choosing the best books to adapt.

## Technical Developments
The project utilized Python as the primary programming language for data collection, cleaning, and analysis. The Selenium library was used to collect the data and the Pandas library was used for data manipulation and preprocessing, while statistical tests were conducted using the SciPy library. Data visualization and reporting were performed using Power BI, which allowed for interactive and visually appealing presentations of the data.

## Product Showcase
The deliverables of this project include:<br>
<br>
The scripts used for data collection, manipulation and testing.
A PPPT presentation summarizing the findings from the hypothesis testing and data analysis.
A Power BI report showcasing the book database, allowing movie directors to explore and filter books based on ratings, votes, actors, and specific books. This report serves as a decision-making tool for directors looking to adapt books into movies.

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis, the project concludes that movies not based on books tend to have significantly higher average gross revenue compared to movies based on books. However, there was no significant difference in average ratings or number of votes between the two categories. This implies that ratings and popularity are not strongly influenced by whether a movie is based on a book or has an original screenplay.
